        <p>I am passionate about gaming, science, basketball, swimming, and playing the trumpet. In addition to gaming, I play every weekend, because I have homework on the weekdays. I play games from mobile to desktop such as clash royale, clash of clans, and league of legends. My favorite subjects would be math science in school because they are usually easier than language arts and social studies. In school, I am the 2nd best turmpet player in the Etiwanda School District band. </p>
